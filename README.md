# hackathon-marketplace

This project was built by Pravesh Jain and Param Aggarwal for Curefit Hackathon 2022. We won second prize for this.

## Components

1. Ability to host external apps inside the Cult mobile app via webview.
2. We made two example apps:
    - Fit Commit: Pool some money together with people who commit to attending X classes per week and pool money is divided among all those who managed to complete the commitment. Data validated by real cult class attendance data.
    - Fit Buddy: Get a buddy assigned from the same center who attends classes roughly at same time. Compete with them in the app by being able to see their past 7 days workout history.
